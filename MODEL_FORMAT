TODO: animations? like animated hair/jiggle physics?

FILE TREE

			/ANGLE (eg. upLft)

TODO: map file to map dirs to special types and define draw order
TYPE       DRAW ORDER
- base     - 0
- eyel     - 1
- eyer     - 2
- eyebrowl - 3
- eyebrowr - 4
- mouth    - 5
- hair     - 6

TODO: map file to map the default emote and emotes to cases (eg. wide eyes)
EMOTE
emote handling
- 'idle' is the fallback emote, any missing file will fallback to 'idle'
- only provide changed files, don't copy 'idle' fully!
- emotes can be named anything, but the default emote must be 'idle'

ANGLES
ANGLE LIST
- proper missing angle handling, other than the neutral ones which are
  required.
- variant angles are concatenated on the end of the main type
- yes, there's a lot to draw (45 angles), just don't draw the ones you're
  happy skipping (some/all of the tilt variants can probably be skipped,
  skipping all tilt angles means only 15 angles)

MOUTH STRUCTURE
TODO:

format:
	/config:
		line1: row offset (for all files)
		line2: column offset (for all files)
	/LAYERNUMBER:
		line1: fg color (7 for default)
		line2: bg color (0 for default)
		line3: attribute (
			0:normal
			1:bold
			2:faint
			3:italic
			4:underline
			5:blink (didn't know this was a thing, it's cool though)
			7:swap fg/bg (probably useless)
			9:strike
		)
		rest: ascii art

LAYERNUMBER: a number, higher numbers are drawn later, 0-9

- Whitespace leaves what's already on the screen alone and is not coloured
- Explicitly coloured whitespace is possible by using a layer where fg=bg
  and any character OTHER than whitespace will appear as coloured whitespace
