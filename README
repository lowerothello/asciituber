ASCIITUBER
----------
Ascii art VTubing software
Renders a VTuber model in your terminal

Features:
---------
- Full text attribute (colours, bold, italics, etc.) support
- Simple, easy to extend to suit your needs
- POSIX compliant, any POSIX incompatibility is an issue and should be reported

Simple Usage:
-------------
A working compiler is required for the first run, you might need to install gcc or similar. Send VRM data to localhost:39539 (the port can be changed at the top of ./vrm), and run './vrm "models/test"'. Any extra usage information can be found by reading the source code or by reading the error messages.

Models:
-------
Example models are in ./models, they are free to use as bases or as is under the same MIT license as this repo is under. Documentation of the format is in ./MODEL_FORMAT (it's pretty badly written, inspect the example models for more up to date info).

Scripts:
--------
# USER FACING
- ./vrm.sh          : reads vrm data from a port and draws the model
- ./editmodel.sh    : repl to make editing models more managable
- ./preview.sh      : shows a debug preview of the model, controlled with ./editmodel.sh, useful when editing models
- ./make.sh         : builds the c components, needs to be run once before use
# LIBRARIES
- ./asciituber.sh   : provides functions to draw and otherwise manipulate models
- ./animations.sh   : provides pre-programmed animations (just test animations rn)
# HELPERS
- ./genposnumbers.sh: add a dummy file header to the text files, was used for migration to a new format, useless now
- ./genbaseright.sh : generates mirrored copies of symmetrical elements

C Components:
-------------
- ./drawblock.c     : mapped to the shell function "drawblock"


# vim: wrap
