ASCIITUBER
----------
Ascii art VTubing software
Renders a VTuber model, in (mostly) POSIX compliant shell

Features:
---------
- Full text attribute (colours, bold, italics, etc.) support
- Simple, easy to modify to suit your needs with a little bit of shell knowledge
- Mostly POSIX compliant, there's a some ${var::} and some read -n and probably some others in here still

Simple Usage:
-------------
Send VRM data to localhost:3940 (the port can be changed at the top of ./asciituber), then run ./asciituber giving a model as an argument. Any extra usage information can be found by reading the scripts. Use an 80x24 terminal, any other sizes need manual adjustment currently.

Models:
-------
Example models are in ./models, they are free to use as a base if you want to. Documentation of the format is in ./MODEL_FORMAT (it's pretty badly written, inspect the example models for more up to date info).

Scripts:
--------
- ./asciituber   : reads vrm data from a port and draws the model
- ./framecycle   : manually program a loop of frames, helps when making models to see how motion looks
- ./drawlib      : sourced internally to actually draw the model
- ./genposnumbers: add a dummy file header to the text files, was used for migration to a new format, useless now
- ./genbaseright : generates mirrored copies of symmetrical elements
