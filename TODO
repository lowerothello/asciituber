- rely less on relative dirs, calling asciituber from any directory other than . breaks things

- drawblock
-- XYWH are a bit broken, W doesn't account for X offset properly
-- inverted colours in a sane way, add a layer where if a char is present then the output should be inverted
-- glitch effects (more motion to feel less stationary, and to lean into the aesthetic)
--- chrommatic abberation type beat (layers drifting independantly)
--- cell colour invert triggerred by noise

- preview changes
-- keybinds
--- panning
