- drawblock
-- XYWH are a bit broken, W doesn't account for X offset properly
-- glitch effects (more motion to feel less stationary, and to lean into the aesthetic)
--- chrommatic abberation type beat (layers drifting independantly)
--- cell colour invert triggerred by noise

- preview changes
-- keybinds
--- panning
